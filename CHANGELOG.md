# 26

## 2026-11-06 — Opportunities discovery and preparation

Added an Opportunities destination to the main portfolio archive, with a chronological listing for manifest-tagged records, explicit opportunity status, a graceful empty state, authoring guidance, and a reusable Markdown research-brief template. No demonstration opportunity was added because the root archive contains no verified professional listing. The separate `capital/` application is unchanged.

| Area | Change |
| --- | --- |
| `main.js` | Added the Opportunities topic and view, date-based listing, organization and status metadata, status fallback to Unverified, and a distinct manifest-load error state. |
| `styles.css` | Added restrained listing metadata styling consistent with the existing archive. |
| `content/opportunities/README.md` | Documented the manifest metadata convention, status rules, and evidence-first authoring process. |
| `content/opportunities/TEMPLATE.md` | Added a reusable opportunity brief with source, eligibility, application, preparation, interview, and verification sections. |
| `content/projects/portfolio.md` | Updated the archive and Markdown-renderer description. |
| `content/manifest.json` | No sample opportunity record added; existing records and parent-child relationships remain intact. |

**Validation:** `node --check main.js`; manifest JSON and all 12 referenced content paths; `git diff --check`; local browser checks of archive navigation, opportunity empty/list/detail states, status fallback and chronology using temporary in-memory fixtures, external-link marking, missing-record and manifest-error handling, existing Town Ruins parent/child navigation, and the independent Capital landing page. Mobile viewport emulation was unavailable in the browser session.

#### Summary

Phase 5 Repair: Corrected three discrepancies identified during Phase 4 audit. (1) Updated CHANGELOG.md Phase 3 entry with accurate Git metadata (commit e867ce3). (2) Enhanced mdToHtml renderer to correctly handle multi-line fenced code blocks and **bold** text formatting in content. (3) Corrected line-count claims in portfolio.md to reflect actual implementation (343 lines main.js, 336 lines styles.css).

#### Summary

Repaired the four acceptance blockers: initial state rendering now starts from the declared state, stale asynchronous content results are ignored, evidence claims and references were corrected, and the contact section now states the absence of a public endpoint honestly.

| Category      | Description |

| Async state  | Added a current-view/current-selection check before cached, successful, or failed content fetches update the DOM. |

#### Summary

| Identity   | Established Alvin Phiri as a Computer Science graduate and Software Engineer, with systems/infrastructure direction stated as development rather than inflated seniority. |
| Projects   | Added durable, progressively scoped Portfolio and Town Ruins content grounded in inspected implementation artifacts. |
| Evidence   | Removed unsupported production, migration-count, metric, and link promises; retained only verified repository and portfolio references. |
| Contact    | Added the verified portfolio and email route without inventing additional profiles or endpoints. |
| Validation  | Rechecked Markdown paths, manifest JSON, JavaScript syntax, evidence claims, URL reachability, and resource-awareness constraints. |

## 2026-08-31 — Knowledge archive visual refinement

**Git context:** branch `main`; baseline commit `7f1c219` (`Document authoritative content population`). This is a working-tree change; no commit was created during this task.

Refined the interface into a quiet, tactile knowledge archive while retaining the Markdown manifest, explicit state model, on-demand fetches, in-memory cache, and stale-response guard. The opening is intentionally sparse; topic, project, and supporting-record views now reveal depth as indexed document entries rather than generic cards.

| Area | Change |
| --- | --- |
| `index.html` | Reframed the application shell as an archive and improved live-region semantics. |
| `main.js` | Preserved navigation states while using native buttons, clear return actions, loading state, document metadata, and child-record disclosure. |
| `styles.css` | Added a restrained CSS-only paper texture, editorial typography, asymmetric reading columns, responsive recomposition, visible focus treatment, and reduced-motion support. |

**Validation:** `node --check main.js`; manifest JSON parsing; all manifest paths verified; `git diff --check`; prohibited runtime/API and external-import scan; desktop and 390px local-browser visual inspection. Public Town Ruins GitHub evidence repositories were reachable at validation time.

---

## 2026-09-01 — Visual refinement acceptance repair

Repaired the two confirmed navigation issues without changing the established visual system: content resources now resolve relative to the loaded module, and newly rendered documents reset to their beginning before receiving focus.

| Area | Change |
| --- | --- |
| `main.js` | Added one module-relative content URL helper for the manifest and Markdown fetches. Document renders now use immediate scroll positioning before focus; menu and project-list navigation retain their existing focus behavior. |

**Validation:** JavaScript syntax, manifest JSON, manifest path resolution, root-relative request scan, prohibited execution scan, static fetch checks, and stale-result guard inspection passed.
